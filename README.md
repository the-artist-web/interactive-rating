<p align="center">Interactive rating refers to a feature on websites or applications that allows users to provide feedback or rate content, products, or services in a dynamic and engaging way. Instead of a simple static rating system, interactive ratings often include elements such as star ratings, sliders, or emoticons that users can interact with to express their opinions. This type of rating system can provide more nuanced feedback and enhance user engagement by making the rating process more interactive and visually appealing. => was created using languages HTML CSS JS</p>
